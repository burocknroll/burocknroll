- 👋 Hi, I’m @burocknroll
- 👀 I’m interested in various things, including my new aim of becoming a well-versed full stack developer and then also hopefully a project manager as well! Other than listening to lo-fi and/or rock during coding sessions, I like reading, drawing and annoying my cat as well!! :3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html; css; java and looking forward to delve into python asap.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can handle and contribute a good amount to.
- 📫 How to reach me; you can reach me via my gmail brkkbbc@gmail.com
